    "comment": "A Read Point is a discretely recorded location that is meant to identify the most specific place at which an EPCIS event took place. Read Points are determined by the EPCIS Capturing Application, perhaps inferred as a function of logical reader if stationary readers are used, perhaps determined overtly by reading a location tag if the reader is mobile, or in general determined by any other means the EPCIS Capturing Application chooses to use. Conceptually, the Read Point is designed to identify “where objects were at the time of the EPCIS event.”",
