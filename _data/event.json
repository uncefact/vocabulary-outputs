            "comment": "The Action type says how an event relates to the lifecycle of the entity being described. For example, AggregationEvent is used to capture events related to aggregations of objects, such as cases aggregated to a pallet. Throughout its life, the pallet load participates in many business process steps, each of which may generate an EPCIS event. The action field of each event says how the aggregation itself has changed during the event: have objects been added to the aggregation, have objects been removed from the aggregation, or has the aggregation simply been observed without change to its membership? The action is independent of the bizStep (of type BusinessStepID) which identifies the specific business process step in which the action took place.  allowed values are: - ADD (The entity in question has been created or added to.) - OBSERVE (Theentityinquestionhasnotbeenchanged:ithasneitherbeencreated,addedto,destroyed,orremovedfrom.) - DELETE (The entity in question has been removed from or destroyed altogether.)"

The disposition field of an event specifies the business condition of the event’s objects, subsequent to the event. The disposition is assumed to hold true until another event indicates a change of disposition. Intervening events that do not specify a disposition field have no effect on the presumed disposition of the object.  The GS1 vocabulary (CBV v2.0) defines 33 possible disposition codes but this specification restricts the options to the minimum set of values that are relevant for supply chain traceability.  "

Conceptually, the Read Point is designed to identify “where objects were at the time of the EPCIS event.”"
